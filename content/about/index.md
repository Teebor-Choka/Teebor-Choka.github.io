# tl;dr
*Student, teacher and academic researcher.*

## Who am I
I am a postdoctoral researcher with a specialization in **Computer Science** and **Machine Learning**, primarily focusing on *functional programming*, *parallel systems*, *deep learning*, *statistical computing* and *data analysis/organization/visualization*.

## What do I want
To teach, inspire and discuss. If you happen to stumble upon something you like on this site, feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Teebor-Choka/) page or shoot me an [e-mail](teebor.choka@gmail.com), I am always open to a pleasant discussion.

## Why am I here
Often, when studying up on a non-trivial topic or solving a complex issue, clear and easy to follow write-ups are scarce. This blog was created as a place to remedy that by documenting what I encounter as I go through my professional life.

## Where am I heading
Only the future can tell...
